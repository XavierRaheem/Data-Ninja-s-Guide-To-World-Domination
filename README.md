Python EDA and Model Testing
As an anime enthusiast, I aimed to blend that with my love of data. In true "isekai" fashion... *cue long title*

🔮 I Was Reincarnated Into a World of Ninjas, So I Launched a Startup for a Criminal Enterprise: A Data Ninja's Guide To World Domination🔮

How I turned chaotic shinobi data into a blueprint for world domination using Python, machine learning, and a dash of mischief.

Mission Objective
Build a criminal enterprise in the Naruto universe by optimizing recruitment, HQ placement, and targeting high-value "clients" (aka the baddest bad guys).

Tools of the Trade
⚔️ Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
🌌 Machine Learning: Linear Discriminative Analysis (LDA), synthetic data generation (ADASYN)
🗺️ Data Storytelling: Geospatial visualizations, feature importance plots

Key Findings
1️⃣ Optimal HQ Location:

Through Feature Importance plots, identified the Land of Flowers as the perfect base (prime location, high access to quality candidates)

2️⃣ Precision Recruitment:

Trained an LDA model (98% precision) that prioritized ninjas with high stealth skills and weapon mastery, useful for high-risk missions.

3️⃣ Talent Hotspots:

Visualized Hidden Mist Village as a goldmine for ruthless operatives (thanks to Seaborn heatmaps and correlation matrices).

4️⃣ Weakness Exploitation:

Pinpointed rival villages vulnerable to sabotage using feature importance analysis (weak defenses, poor leadership loyalty).

What I’d Improve
Synthetic Data Generation: Use ADASYN to balance imbalanced datasets (e.g., too many genin, not enough S-rank criminals).

Predictive Expansion: Build a time-series model to forecast territory gains (because even Madara needed a roadmap).

Why This Matters for Recruiters
Why This Matters for Recruiters
This project demonstrates:
✅ Technical Rigor: Cleaning messy "mission logs," optimizing models, and creating actionable dashboards.
✅ Business Impact: Linking data insights to KPIs like reduced recruitment costs and maximized mission success rates.
✅ Storytelling Flair: Transforming complex analysis into a compelling narrative (yes, even for criminal enterprises).

🗨️ Question for you: If you were a villain in the Naruto universe, what data-driven tactic would you use to conquer the Five Nations?
